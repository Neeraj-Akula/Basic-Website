                    <p>There have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an
                        approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared,
                        often without monetary compensation. None of the projects have succeeded in developing a car as
                        a whole including both hardware and software, and no mass production ready open-source based
                        designs have been introduced.</p>

                    <p> Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are
                        used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle
                        can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to
                        indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions
                        of the driver; white-colored reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate
                        that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side
                        marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car.

                        Since motorcycles are lighter than almost all cars, they can accelerate more quickly. But it
                        also makes them not as safe as cars, because they do not have a protecting chassis around them
                        like cars. Very often motorcycle riders are injured heavily in accidents. Motorcycle riders
                        should wear a helmet and other protective clothing like shoes and gloves, of which some have
                        armor. This special clothing may reduce the rider's injuries in an accident. Motorcycles also do
                        not protect riders against wind and rain. That makes it difficult to drive in winter or during
                        bad weather.
